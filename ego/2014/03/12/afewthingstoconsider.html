                <p>Living is hard, emotionally demanding and most of times it looks like a pointless thing to do.</p>

<p>If you suddenly feel that you&#39;re surrounded by asshats, you might just had a moment of enlightenment. This doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re special or differ from those around you. You should have observed that humans are (generally) social animals. <mark>That means that most of us, deep inside, want to be an attractive person.</mark> That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they want a tight, muscular body, we might just want to be fun, witty, skillful in something we think is appealing to others or we might just want to be wealthy as fuck. Sometimes it seems that being nice to others is just a secondary, unnecessary thing. Usually when you see somebody acting as a douche, actually he/she is just trying to reach this attractiveness at the expense of others.</p>

<p>Also being selfish is only natural. When there is a scarce resource, a competition for something of  value you will see how ~4 billion years of natural selection marked life’s morals. Don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re only machines built by and for our genes, our only purpose in life is to make backup copies of these genes. When you succeed in seizing these resources stop for a moment and consider if it&#39;s worthy trampling the weak to the ground.
Cheer up, even if you&#39;re the one being trampled on. Every victory is temporary; and even if this is your ultimate defeat, you share 99% of the victor’s gene pool.</p>

<p>Never forget, that life is just a few moments of happiness in the vast ocean of pain and sorrow. You will eventually drown, but knowing this should free you from all the worries and anxieties associated with life. <a href="http://pastebin.com/JY3naHBg">Just as owning a watch can make you slave of time or free you from every problem associated with it.</a></p>

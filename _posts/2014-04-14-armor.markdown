This is the first book that i've found worth reading, browsing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/22p8tk/just_reread_armor_by_john_steakly_still_as/">r/books.</a> Not that i despise the community, but generally speaking, it's just the same old ellipticaljerk over popular books.

It's super cheesy. The best scifi I've read this year. Through the pages it's balancig on the golden middle path, it's not too deep and not too superficial; describes the scenes in detail but has a lot of action. It's a pulp fiction, all right? But damn, it makes you belive that it's a lot more, and keeps this illusion till the end - and a bit after that.
